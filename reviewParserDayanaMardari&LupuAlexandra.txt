class Grammar:
	-we would suggest to erase the code that is commented and it is not used

Parser:
	-nice touch, the fact that you used enum data structure
	-the comments for the specific functions for recursive descendent parser are very useful for someone which is seeing the code for the first time
	-the granularity of the functions is very intuitive
	-we would suggest to erase the code that is commented and it is not used
	-clean code for the algorithms, they can be easily read and understand

ParserOutput:
	-we would suggest that each class should be in a separate file, the class Node may be moved in a separate file
